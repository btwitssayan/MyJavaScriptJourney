# JavaScript Projects Collection

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects, each demonstrating various features and functionalities such as DOM manipulation, event handling, promises, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The projects are organized into different folders, with individual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each example or exercise.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
    cd your-repo-folder
    ```
2. Open any of the HTML files in the `Projects` directory or `DOM`, `Events`, etc., to view the demos in your browser.

## Usage
Simply open the `.html` files in any modern browser to run the associated JavaScript code.

For example:
```bash
open JS/Project\ 1/index.html
```




## Features
This repository demonstrates a wide range of JavaScript functionalities:

- DOM Manipulation: The DOM folder contains examples of how to interact with HTML elements, including DOM.html, DOM.js, etc.
- Event Handling: The Events folder demonstrates various ways to capture and respond to user actions such as clicks, key presses, and custom events.
- Promises: The promises folder illustrates asynchronous programming using JavaScript promises.
- Object-Oriented Programming: The Classes and OOP folder showcases examples of OOP principles, including classes, prototypes, and static properties.
- Mini Projects: Four distinct projects (Project 1 to Project 4) that put together concepts learned through the examples.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

```bash
JS/
├── DOM/
│   ├── DOM.html
│   ├── DOM.js
│   └── ...
├── Events/
│   ├── eventbasic.js
│   ├── keyTracker/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   └── scripts.js
│   └── ...
├── Classes_and_OOP/
│   ├── class_basics.js
│   ├── inheritance.js
│   └── ...
├── Promises/
│   └── promise.js
├── Projects/
│   ├── Project 1/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── style.css
│   ├── Project 2/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── styles.css
│   ├── ...
└── .git/
```

Each folder has a focused topic or project. For instance:

- DOM: Files related to DOM manipulation.
- Events: Examples related to event handling.
- Classes and OOP: Exercises demonstrating object-oriented JavaScript.
- Promises: Simple examples of using promises in JavaScript.
